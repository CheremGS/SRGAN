### Description
* Run model train via trainers/modelTrainRun.py file with according mode
* Run test via modelTester.py file

### Implemented features
- Trainers for pretrain generator model and GAN 
- Loggers for generator pretrain and GAN train
- Inference with comparison models (interpolation and gan)
- Dataset for GAN train and generator pretrain
- Adversarial and perception loss
- Configuration with yaml file
- Save train runs info in various folders 


#### ToDo:
- Implement new gan model or approach
- Implement run train/test from console
- Calculate inference time
